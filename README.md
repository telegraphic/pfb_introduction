### Polyphase filterbanks: an interactive introduction

This repository provides some useful materials for understanding polyphase filterbanks (PFBs). Foremostly, this repo provides an [interactive notebook](pfb_introduction.ipynb) that gives a gentle walkthrough of how polyphase filterbanks work. Also provided is [Python PFB code](pfb.py), some supplementary [diagrams](diagrams/) and a list of useful [references](references.md).

#### Getting started

While you can view the notebook on github, it's more illustrative to run it youself. To run the notebook on your local computer, you'll need to clone this repo and have a working scientific python environment installed (`jupyter`, `numpy`, `scipy` and `seaborn`). If you don't have this set up, the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) python environment is a good choice.

To run the notebook, start the jupyter notebook server running from the pfb_introduction directory, by running on the command line:

```
> jupyter notebook
```

This will open your browser, from which you can launch the pfb_introduction.ipynb notebook.
